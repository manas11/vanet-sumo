## Gorakhpur simulation
The simulation assocaited with the map of Gorakhpur are summarized here.

The struture of this directory is as follow:

- [map-data](./map-data):  The OSM data of the Gorakhpur map and the generated ns2 mobility file is present here.
- [Moving-Simulation-1-2048bps](./Moving-Simulation-1-2048bps/): The simulation results of ARF, constant rate and RRA are stored in this directory for the moving simulation 1 with vehicles moving at 10m/s and data rate is 2048bps. This also include graphs of the obatined output and the Netanim trace file.
- [Moving-Simulation-2-10Mbps](./Moving-Simulation-2-10Mbps/): The simulation results of ARF, constant rate and RRA are stored in this directory for the moving simulation 1 with vehicles moving at 10m/s and data rate is 10Mbps. This also include graphs of the obatined output and the Netanim trace file.
- [Static-Simulation-1-2048bps](./Static-Simulation-1-2048bps/): The simulation results of ARF, constant rate and RRA are stored in this directory for the moving simulation 1 with static vehicles and data rate is 2048bps. This also include graphs of the obatined output and the Netanim trace file.
- [Static-Simulation-2-10Mbps](./Static-Simulation-2-10Mbps): The simulation results of ARF, constant rate and RRA are stored in this directory for the moving simulation 1 with static vehicles and data rate is 10Mbps. This also include graphs of the obatined output and the Netanim trace file.
