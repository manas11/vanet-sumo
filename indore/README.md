## Indore simulation
The simulation assocaited with the map of Indore are summarized here.

The struture of this directory is as follow:

- [map-data](./map-data):  The OSM data of the Indore map and the generated ns2 mobility file is present here.
- [Simulation-1-32cars-2048bps](./Simulation-1-32cars-2048bps/): The simulation results of ARF, constant rate and RRA are stored in this directory for the simulation 1 with 32 vehicles and data rate is 2048bps. This also include graphs of the obatined output and the Netanim trace file.
- [Simulation-2-32cars-10Mbps](./Simulation-2-32cars-10Mbps/): The simulation results of ARF, constant rate and RRA are stored in this directory for the simulation 2 with 32 vehicles and data rate is 10Mbps. This also include graphs of the obatined output and the Netanim trace file.
- [Simulation-3-20cars-2048bps](./Simulation-3-20cars-2048bps): The simulation results of ARF, constant rate and RRA are stored in this directory for the simulation 3 with 20 vehicles and data rate is 2048bps. This also include graphs of the obatined output and the Netanim trace file.
- [Simulation-4-64cars-2048bps](./Simulation-4-64cars-2048bps): The simulation results of ARF, constant rate and RRA are stored in this directory for the simulation 4 with 64 vehicles and data rate is 2048bps. This also include graphs of the obatined output and the Netanim trace file.
- [Simulation-5-128cars-2048bps](./Simulation-5-128cars-2048bps): The simulation results of ARF, constant rate and RRA are stored in this directory for the simulation 5 with 128 vehicles and data rate is 2048bps. This also include graphs of the obatined output and the Netanim trace file.
